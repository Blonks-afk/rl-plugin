# Features
The plugin is divided into three tabs: the slots tab, flipping tab and statistics tab. 

### The Flipping Tab

#### Recipe flips

Sometimes, flips aren't straightforward selling and buying of the same item - they involve combining several items
into one or transforming an item into another. For accurately capturing the profits for these complicated trades, you
can create a "recipe flip".

Go to your offers for an item in the stats tab. If there is a recipe for that item, a recipe flip button will
be present on the offer card. Click it and select the appropriate recipe

</p>

adjust the inputs and outputs if necessary, then combine

</p>

view your recipe flips in the "recipes" tab of the stats tab

## Additional Features

#### Slot timers

Slot timers help you figure out when you should cancel an offer. They show you how long it has been 
since the offer was last active.
